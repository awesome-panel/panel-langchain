We believe Panel
provides some unique and powerful features for creating chat bots and AI agents in Python like
async, streaming, jupyter notebook support, HoloViz integration and Ipywidgets integration. We want
to make it easy to use Panel and LangChain to build AI tools and apps.

This repository contains reference implementations of various LangChain agents as Panel apps.

Check out the [examples](/examples) folder.

Currently our examples are aligned with the
[langchainai/streamlit-agent](https://github.com/langchain-ai/streamlit-agent) examples.

THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY JUST AN IDEA.
